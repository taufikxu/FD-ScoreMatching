# FD-ScoreMatching

This repository contains the codes for reproducing most of the results of our paper: Efficient Learning of Generative Models via Finite-Difference Score Matching


## Environment settings and libraries we used in our experiments

This project is tested under the following environment settings:
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04.4
- GPU: Geforce 1080 Ti
- Cuda: 10.1, Cudnn: v7.6
- Python: 3.6.10
- PyTorch: 1.4.0
- Torchvision: 0.5.0
- scipy: 1.2.0

For convenience, we provide the *requirement.txt* file to install the virtualenv that is sufficient run the codes.

## Usage

The command used to reproduce our quantitative results are provided in the README files of the three subfolders.
